<p>Spiders (order Araneae) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs,
chelicerae with fangs generally able to inject venom, and spinnerets that extrude silk. 
They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all orders of organisms. 
Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica, and have become established in nearly every land habitat.
 As of August 2022, 50,356 spider species in 132 families have been recorded by taxonomists.
 However, there has been debate among scientists about how families should be classified, with over 20 different classifications proposed since 1900.
